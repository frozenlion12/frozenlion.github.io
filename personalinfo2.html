            <ul>
                <p>Music is part of our daily lives. Some people are starting their day by playing their favorite music before they do what they gotta do</p>
                <p>Music helps me focus but I will become distracted when the song is my favorite because I will sing along despite my horrible voice LOL!</p>
                <p>My music taste change randomly depends on what my mood is. My favorite in music is Pop, K-pop, J-pop and OPM</p>
                <p>I have so many favorite songs that I can't choose among them which is my most favorite but one of my favorite songs are Lilac, Blueming and Celebrity by IU(a South Korean versatile actress and a singer)</p>

            <h1>Games</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>Playing is the one I have been doing since I was a child. From playing Luksong Baka, Langit-Lupa, Patintero to Mobile Legends, Call of Duty, League of Legends and etc..</p>
                <p>For me, playing games is for relaxing and stress relief</p>
                <p>My favorite games nowadays is Mobile Legends because I can play with my friends there. And the more the friends you play with, the merrier(but the max for playing together in ML is only 5 players tho)</p>
