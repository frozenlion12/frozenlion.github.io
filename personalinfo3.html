                <p>I did many bad things that make my teachers mad, it's understandable since that time I am a naive and all in my was to play, play and play</p>
                <p>I'm not just a silly kid back then, I also help out my friends when they got a problem</p>
                <p>I even remember the time that I gave my lunch to my friends when they dont have any food to eat in recess time</p>

                <p>This is the school my classmate want to go if he graduate, so we planned to study here after we graduate</p>
                <p>But the things went awry when the pandemic came, and now we are studying via online class</p>
                <p>Because of VHA, I made so many friends and also made many happy memories together</p>
                <p>This is the school year I won't regret despite the hardship we faced because of the pandemic</p>
